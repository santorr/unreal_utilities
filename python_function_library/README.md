# Create blueprint library (nodes) with python
![Img](resources/resource_0.JPG)

# Knowledges
Nodes created with Python only work in the editor â€” not at runtime!

## Supported
- Unreal Engine types (e.g., `unreal.Vector`, `unreal.StaticMesh`, etc.)
- Multiple inputs

## Not supported yet
- Multiple outputs

# Misc
This message simply means that Unreal automatically reconnected your Python function to the new library after the link had previously been broken. This is normal behavior when creating Blueprint nodes with Python.
